        <h3>Chemistry</h3>
        <p>
          My Undergraduate studies were in the field of Chemistry, a subject that still holds a place in my heart. In particular, I enjoy learning more about Physical Chemistry and following the logical paths of Reaction Mechanisms.

        <h3>Geophysics and Planetary Physics</h3>
        <p>
          When I started Grad school I made the seemingly odd transition to studying Geophysics, but discovered further proof different scientific fields are not so different afterall. It was here that I really became a fan of multi-disciplinary
          approaches to solving problems. I'm still fascinated by the awesome power and intricate complexity of planetary physics even though I don't study it as much anymore. I also loving watching kitchy disaster films with just enough good
          science to get <em>everything</em> wrong.

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>More recently I have taken my sporadic programming experiences of the past and forged them into a more direct and concrete approach. Programming provides a great exercise in logic and is a constantly changing field. I look forward to
          always having something new to learn.</p>
